        <i>The Sferic Project</i> is an ongoing art and research project
        studying Earth's natural radio and atmospheric noise. The project
        involves recording data in the wild using a Very Low Frequency (VLF)
        radio receiver, and transcribing this into a digital format. These
        recordings are being used as a source of random entropy for new
        cryptographic protocols and generative artworks.

      <h2>natural radio</h2>
      <p>
        All around the world, there are about 44 lightning strikes happening
        every second. This activity emits electromagnetic energy that can be
        picked up thousands of kilometers away with a radio receiver tuned to a
        frequency range between 300 Hz and 13 kHz (designated the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency"
          target="_blank"
          >Very Low Frequency or VLF band</a
        >). These signals occur in the audible frequency range, so humans 'hear'
        this atmospheric noise as an endless stream of pops, cracks, and
        whistles — collectively known as <i>sferics</i>.

      <h2>radio as a source of randomness</h2>
      <p>
        As randomness lies at the core of so many generative artworks, I've
        found it interesting to study and experiment with alternative sources of
        random entropy. To produce randomness, most computer systems — including
        modern cryptographic protocols and generative art — make use of
        pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). These are designed to generate
        sequences of numbers that <i>appear</i> random over large periods, but
        in reality they are driven by deterministic and predictable arithmetic.
        Atmospheric noise is interesting in that its properties are more akin to
        a
        <a href="https://www.random.org/randomness/" target="_blank"
          >true random number generator</a
        >
        that is non-deterministic and aperiodic.

      <h2>escaping the grid</h2>
      <p>
        The most fascinating aspect of capturing sferics, and what drew me into
        this, is the need to escape the urban sprawl. If you turn on a VLF radio
        receiver in your city, you'll mostly only capture the 50 or 60 Hz hum of
        electricity generated by the power grid. In order to get a clean signal,
        you need to be kilometers from the nearest power line, in a remote
        location untouched by the constant mass of electromagnetic radiation of
        modern human technology. Underground power lines, nearby cell towers,
        electronic devices, and even mobile phones can interfere with your
        recording. Finding a clean source has proven challenging, driving me to
        continually venture further afield.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have so far captured recordings in remote locations in South Korea,
        Japan, and the United Kingdom, with plans to continue recording in other
        locations worldwide.

      <h2>entropy for cryptogrpahic means</h2>
      <p>
        In April 2023, a recording of atmospheric noise along the southern coast
        of the United Kingdom was used as a source of random entropy for
        Ethereum's
        <a
          href="https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony/blob/main/FAQ.md"
          target="_blank"
          >KZG Ceremony</a
        >. This is a collective initive to make a trusted setup for a new
        polynomial commitment scheme that can help improve Ethereum's
        scalability. The ceremony included thousands of participants worldwide,
        and a small handful of "special contributions" that made use of creative
        sources of random entropy. <i>The Sferic Project</i> was granted a
        special contribution slot by the Ethereum Foundation, and a recording of
        random atmospheric noise was submitted to the KZG Ceremony sequencer on
        April 14th, 2023 (participant
        <a href="https://ceremony.ethereum.org/#/record" target="_blank"
          >#83340</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        The microSD card containing the recorded radio data was loaded directly
        onto an air-gapped Raspberry Pi Model B without internet, with
        computations performed locally. Afterwards, the memory card containing
        the radio data was formatted and then physically destroyed with scissors
        to ensure my secret commitment will never be known, not even by me.

      <h2>future work</h2>
      <p>
        This is a long-term project that will progress slowly over the course of
        many months. With each new recording, I learn a little more about how
        best to avoid interference and steer clear of unwanted sources of
        electromagnetic radiation. I plan to use these recordings as a source of
        randomness for a new series of generative and audio-visual artworks, to
        be released at a later date.
